# pgRouting-express
Express API for pgRouting

A short-term playground for learning express, postgresql and pgRouting until I find something better.

Goal - create a node-based service to act as directions API for pgRouting. 
To implement the Open Routing Service API in Typescript to run on node. 
To have any open implementations of http://openrouteservice.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api.html.

API - to become compatible with MapQuest or ESRI Routing?
